Nikhil Patel is a results-driven Full Stack and AI-focused Software Engineer with over **3.5 years of experience** designing, building, and scaling production-grade systems across backend, frontend, cloud, and GenAI domains. His career demonstrates a consistent pattern of **end-to-end ownership**, rapid learning, and delivering solutions that significantly enhance product quality, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

He began his professional journey as a **Full Stack Developer Intern** at InfiniumDevio, where he quickly learned React and Node.js and contributed to multiple core modules, building 10–15 RESTful APIs and integrating them with frontend systems. This early exposure to full-stack development shaped his ability to independently own features across the stack.

Joining **o2h Technology** marked a major shift in scope and impact. As **Associate Software Engineer I**, he led the development of the company’s in-house **Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN)** module. He architected the backend (Adonis.js), frontend (React.js), and database schema, integrating it seamlessly into existing systems. This initiative eliminated the need for external vendor tools, delivering **100% cost savings** and improving workflow efficiency by reducing chemical update time by 60%. He also improved onboarding processes, reducing developer setup time by 50%.

Growing into **Associate Software Engineer II**, Nikhil took ownership of critical components of the award-winning **CITC (Chemistry in the Cloud)** platform. He designed and implemented advanced chemical search functionality using Python and RDKit, supporting 10–12 external clients and 200+ internal users. He later optimized operational costs by migrating workloads from AWS Lambda to FastAPI on EC2, achieving **100% cost reduction**. He also contributed to GenAI initiatives—fine-tuning GPT-3.5 with custom datasets and integrating OpenAI Assistants into workflow automation.

As a **Senior Associate Software Engineer II**, his role expanded into client-facing responsibilities, cloud integrations, and AI/LLM engineering. He integrated **LangChainJS** to improve OpenAI JSON reliability from 60% to 99% and boosted output quality from 50% to 90%. His contributions to **WriteRecruit**—delivering all three project phases—drove a smooth transition to live users and resulted in a **client satisfaction score of 4.8/5**. He also improved internal developer operations by integrating a Jenkins Bot into Mattermost, reducing access time by 50% and strengthening access control security.

Throughout his journey, Nikhil has showcased a strong command over **JavaScript, Python, React.js, Node.js, AWS**, and modern AI tooling including **OpenAI APIs, LangChain, and prompt engineering**. His work consistently combines deep technical skill with the ability to solve real-world business problems—making him a well-rounded engineer ready for high-impact full-stack and AI-driven roles.
