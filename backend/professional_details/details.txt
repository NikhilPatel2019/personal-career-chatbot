# **Detailed Professional Career Summary — First-Person Version**

My name is **Nikhil Patel**, and I come from a small town in Navsari called Maroli. I completed my primary schooling there up to the 8th standard, after which I moved to Navsari for higher studies. I scored **81% in Class 10** and **59% in Class 12**, and despite the drop, I bounced back strongly during my engineering degree. I completed my **Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering** from Ahmedabad with a **9.3 CGPA**.

During college, I actively participated in hackathons and built a project called **MedEarn**, a platform to buy and sell medicines, using **React, Node.js, and MongoDB**. This project helped shape my interest in building full-stack applications end-to-end.
